copy number and beta allele frequency (BAF) profiles, then calls copy number
alterations and LOH.  The control (matched normal) sample is optional for whole
genome sequencing data but mandatory for whole exome or targeted sequencing
data.  For whole genome sequencing data analysis, the program can also use
mappability data (files created by GEM). ")
