so that natural sort function arranges a character vector by their numbers,
not digit characters.  It is typically seen when operating systems lists
file names.  For example, a sequence a-1.png, a-2.png, a-10.png looks
naturally ordered because 1 < 2 < 10 and natural sort algorithm arranges
so whereas general sort algorithms arrange it into a-1.png, a-10.png,
a-2.png owing to their third and fourth characters.")
