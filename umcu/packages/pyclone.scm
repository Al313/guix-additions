    (description "PyClone is a tool for inferring the cellular prevalence of
point mutations from deeply sequenced data.  The model supports simultaneous
analysis of multiple related samples and infers clusters of mutations whose
cellular prevalences shift together.  Such clusters of mutations can be
inferred as mutational genotypes of distinct clonal populations.")
