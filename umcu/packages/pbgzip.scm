      (synopsis "Parallel Block GZIP")
      (description "This tool and API implements parallel block gzip.  For many
formats, in particular Genomics Data Formats, data are compressed in
fixed-length blocks such that they can be easily indexed based on a (genomic)
coordinate order, since typically each block is sorted according to this order.
This allows for each block to be individually compressed (deflated), or more
importantly, decompressed (inflated), with the latter enabling random retrieval
of data in large files (gigabytes to terabytes).  @code{pbgzip} is not limited
to any particular format, but certain features are tailored to Genomics Data
Formats when enabled (see below). Parallel decompression is somewhat faster,
but truly the speedup comes during compression.")
